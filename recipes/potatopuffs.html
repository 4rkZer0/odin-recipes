    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This super crunchy twist on classic fries will certainly wow your guests and leave them wanting more.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large Idaho potatoes, boiled, skins removed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups potato starch</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt, for garnish</li>
        <li>Dried parsley flakes, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mash the potatoes until completely smooth. Add the kosher salt, black pepper, and potato starch and mix until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Roll the potato mixture into ½-inch-wide balls.</li>
        <li>Fill a medium pot halfway with vegetable oil. Heat over medium heat until the temperature reaches 350°F (180°C).</li>
        <li>Working a few at a time, fry the potato balls in the hot oil until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes, stirring to prevent the balls from sticking together. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and sprinkle with flaky salt and dried parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately. Leftovers will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. To reheat, air fry at 350°F (180°C) for 3–5 minutes, until warmed through.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
